                    The WDCH is home to the Los Angeles Philharmonic and serves as a venue for many other
                    music groups.

                    Lillian Disney donated to the Music Center, which has historically been close to the 
                    Disney family, to have this concert hall built. She deemed the hall to be a "permanent 
                    tribute to [her] late husband, Walt Disney" [2].
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    The building also serves as a "living room for the city" [2]. The curved design of the lobby for the 
                    building encourages conversation, movement, and has a welcoming mood to it. It stands out from its relatively static 
                    urban environment and provides a friendly atmosphere.

                    <li>
                    While the concert hall is primarily for people who want to attend a concert, it is also a common place for residents 
                    to just "come together and feel comfortable doing so" [2].

                    The thousands of unique stainless steel panels add a surprising deal of texture to 
                    the "sails" of the building. The texture on each sail varies, with some having 
                    very smooth and large panels and others having many small panels that give off a 
                    more scaly texture.
                    <br><br>
                    Fun fact: Gehry's originally intended for the building to be made of stone rather than its iconic stainless steel.

                    The concert hall also has an interesting sense of balance to it. Looking at it from 
                    afar, the building feels quite cohesive as the sails on one side of the building 
                    are contrasted by those on the other side. There is a harmonious mix between 
                    convex and concave sails.
                    <br><br>
                    The Walt Disney Concert Hall stands out in its urban surroundings largely because of its 
                    shapes. Its unique convex and concave sails appear flexible and fluid, standing in 
                    stark contrast to that of the city's rigid walls and streets.

                    The Walt Disney Concert Hall is in an urban setting. The surrounding buildings all 
                    follow the same structure: they have white walls and lots of windows. The hall stands 
                    out in that it is made of steel and has an absence of windows. The steel sails appear 
                    sort of symbolically as the sails bounce off the rest of the city's atmosphere. The hall
                    creates its own bubble of influence and vibes.

                    The curved shape of the outside of the concert hall is maintained from the exterior 
                    to the interior of the building. There is, however, a soft transition in color and 
                    material: the outside is stainless steel and the inside has wood panels. The curved 
                    walls of the building make the lobby appear more open and fluid. This is good for 
                    the function of a lobby where people can socialize and follow the flow of the building.

                <u>summary:</u>
                The lobby being distributed over multiple floors is intended to add intimacy to the 
                musical experience as people checking in feel like they are attending a smaller concert than 
                they really are. The concert hall itself took many of the acoustic factors into account with 
                its internal curved design. The concavity of the place resulted in problems that needed to be 
                addressed like focusing acoustics with panels and rearranging seating thirty times. [3]

                <p>
                <u>summary:</u>
                Building materials and curvature are factors that need to be properly addressed with modern architecture as it can 
                negatively impact its miroclimate -- its immediate surrounding area. When walking around certain areas of the building,
                it is possible to feel more intense heat and light. Visual discomfort and intense solar glare are risks that come with 
                using a reflective material like steel. Aesthetic is one thing to handle, safety is another. [7]

                    I tried to capture the concert hall's fluid and playful nature. Every aspect from the 
                    railings to the sails has a curve and warped look to it. I think this unique shape to the 
                    building is critical to capture because it is reminiscent of Walt Disney's legacy: his 
                    imagination fueled a great deal of our childhood memories.
                    <br><br>
                    The top of the Walt Disney Concert Hall reminds me of Mickey Mouse's ears, and I wanted
                    to accentuate that feature in my drawing. Also, I made sure that the sails had different 
                    patterns to them because it would not feel right to make a building dedicated to Disney's 
                    legacy so uniform and static.

                The outside of the concert hall can also be used as a way to display art. Using projectors 
                and machine learning, it is possible to display an image or video across the sails of the hall.

                The hall's sails are already artistic and unique; however, the addition of the ability to display 
                color and life onto them adds that much more grandeur and awe to the building.

                Although the exterior gets the most attention, Gehry's design and ideas revolve around the inside. For example, in the 
                music hall, $5 million dollars was spent on wood decoration because of its psychological effect: there is a positive 
                psychological impact with wood as people associate orchestral music with it. Gehry also alludes to the principle of 
                "form follows function" by talking about the issue of connecting the toilets to the stairs. Transitioning to the exterior,
                Gehry says that he originally wanted stone because it would pick up ambient light and have soft lighting easily, but switched 
                to metal after people lauded the usage of titanium at Bilbao.

                    In the competition for the concert hall commission, Gehry was voted unanimously despite being a sort of underdog. His 
                    design took guidelines and the environment around where the hall would be built into account. His design was 
                    genius for its "treatment of public circulation spaces" [10].
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Rather than focus on theory, Gehry relied on intuition and pragmatism. A lot of his thought process was enacted through
                    "chunky abstract wooden blocks and cardboard slabs" [10].

                    The Walt Disney Concert Hall is intended to be a metaphorical flower. In terms of the exterior architecture, it mimics 
                    a "giant Easter lily with walls like spreading petals" [10]. It is meant to vividly represent LA as both the building and 
                    the city blossom in their surroundings. Gehry thinks its representation of LA will rival that of the Sydney Opera House's 
                    representation of Australia.

                <h2>Blog: <i>Review of Disney Hall: Reflection of the city around it</i></h2>
                <p>
                The author argues that the most moving part of the concert hall is that it recognizes that "ideal beauty rarely exists 
                in an imperfect world" [11]. They also argue that it expresses modern cultural values and is a work of social commentary. The 
                piece goes into depth about aspects of the building that articulate the subtle depths of it, but I do not really see it. While 
                I admire the architecture and attention to detail. After watching the interview with Frank Gehry and reading this post, I respect the 
                building a lot more as there was a lot of work that went into even small psychological aspects. However, the post appears a bit too 
                pretentious about the social commentary aspect. Its claims remain too unsubstantiated to influence me.
